# PokemonBattleBuddy
Website designed to help users know Pokemon type effectiveness on both offense and defense without memorizing charts

How to use:
--Attack Section
1. Select the move-type of Pokemon move you would like to use (ex. Fire for Flamethrower)
2. Press the "ATTACK" button at the bottom of the section
3. Read which types will receive 2x, 1/2x, or 0x damage from your selected Attack move
(Note: if a move type is not listed, your selected move-type will do 1x damage)

--Defense Section
1. Select your defending Pokemon's type(s)
(Note: for now, users may select more than the maximum 2 types a Pokemon can have. The website will only return the results of the first two types selected based on sequential order shown on the page (left>right + top>bottom))
2. Press the "DEFEND" button at the bottom of the section
3. Read which attack move-types will do 2x, 1/2x, or 0x to your Pokemon
(Note: current functionality will return all weaknesses from both selected types, resulting in possible duplication of types in multiple result areas. Future fuctionality to remove duplicates and calculate dual-type resistances is in development.)
